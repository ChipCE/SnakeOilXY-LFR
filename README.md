# SnakeOilXY-LFR

SnakeOilXY-LFR (Large format FR4) is a complete redesign inspired by the [Voron 2.x](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2) with the goal of achieving better performance, scalability, reliability, and reduced maintenance. By incorporating FR4 for structural parts alongside printed components and utilizing a metal core reinforced design, it results in a more robust motion system that is less affected by the characteristics of the filament used in the printed parts. Furthermore, it is more suitable for large format machines.

## Project goals

- 4 motors coreXY kinematic.
- Zero-play Z joints with vibration damper built-in.
- 9mm belt on XY axis, 12mm belt on Z axis.
- Hybrid 3D printed + FR4 structural parts .
- AUX fan support.
- Active-ish chamber heater.
- Better support and reliability for MMU/filament-loader units. 
- Thermal expansion compensation bed mount
